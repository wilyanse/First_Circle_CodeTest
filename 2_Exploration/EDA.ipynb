Unfortunately, since the values for `trans_date` cannot be implied by other aspects of the dataset, the best course of action here would be to drop the rows with nulll `trans_date` values despite losing valuable data. This is because we want good quality data rather than having some data that we are unsure of."

    "### Summary\n",
    "1. `transactions-1.csv` contains a list of transactions made with their own unique primary id stored as `trans_id` which needs non-null values for `user_id`, `product`, and `trans_date`.\n",
    "2. For each `product` in a transaction, there is a corresponding `amount` which stays uniform throughout the dataset.\n",
    "3. The ideal datatypes for each column is as follows:\n",
    "    - `trans_id`: int\n",
    "    - `user_id`: int\n",
    "    - `product`: string\n",
    "    - `amount`: float\n",
    "    - `trans_date`: datetime\n",
    "4. The dataset contains 84 entries total, with 1 entry having a null value for the `trans_date` and 2 entries having invalid values for `amount`.\n",
    "5. For null or invalid values in `user_id`, `product`, and `trans_date`, the best course of action is to drop the entry as there is no way to infer the value for each entry.\n",
    "6. For null or invalid values in `amount`, the value can be inferred from previous entries in the dataset. (`pricing.csv` might also be used due to the filename and columns listed in the specs but it is assumed in this context that only the `transactions.csv` file was provided as the dataset)\n",
    "7. For null or invalid values in `trans_id`, there might be a workaround that involves obtaining a unique id of its own by incrementing the largest value `trans_id` but comprimising the nature of the original dataset of having a pre-sorted CSV file."
